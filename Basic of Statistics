Basics of Statistics:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is statistics:
	-statistics is the methodology for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and drawing conclusions from information or data. 
Measures of center:Descriptive measures that indicate where the center or the most typical value of the variable lies in collected set of measurements are called measures of center
	Mean:
		-The sample mean of the variable is the sum of observed values in a data divided by the number of observations.
		
	Median:	
		-The sample median of a quantitative variable is that value of the variable in a data set that divides the set of observed values in half
		-Arrange the observed values of variable in a data in increasing order.
			1. If the number of observation is odd, then the sample median is the
			observed value exactly in the middle of the ordered list.
			2. If the number of observation is even, then the sample median is the
			number halfway between the two middle observed values in the ordered
			list.
	
	Mode:
		- The sample mode of a qualitative or a discrete quantitative variable is that value of the variable which occurs with the greatest frequency in a data set.
		- Obtain the frequency of each observed value of the variable in a data and note the greatest frequency.
			1. If the greatest frequency is 1 (i.e. no value occurs more than once),
			then the variable has no mode.
			2. If the greatest frequency is 2 or greater, then any value that occurs with
			that greatest frequency is called a sample mode of the variable.

Measures of variation: Its a measure of variation of variable from the center
	Range:
		- The sample range of the variable is the difference between its maximum and minimum values in a data set:
	Interquartile range:
		- The sample interquartile range of the variable, denoted IQR, is the difference between the first and third quartiles of the variable, that is,
		IQR = Q3 âˆ’ Q1.
		Roughly speaking, the IQR gives the range of the middle 50% of the observed values.
		-The first quartile Q1 is at position (n+1)/4
		-The second quartile Q2 (the median) is at position (n+1)/2
		-The Third quartile Q3 is at position 3*(n+1)/4
		The five-number summary of the variable consists of minimum, maximum, and quartiles written in increasing order:
			Min, Q1, Q2, Q3, Max.
	Standard deviation:
		-It can be considered as a kind of average of the absolute deviations of observed values from the mean of the variable in question.

Z-score:
	It is calcuated with the below formula:
		Z-score = (X - Mean)/Standard Deviation
